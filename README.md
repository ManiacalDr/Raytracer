# Raytracer
This program uses the Ray tracing method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) for determining the color of objects in a scene. Currently the only shape it supports is spheres.

# How to Run
Currently running the program would require you to compile the program yourself, on the command line. A makefile is provided, use "make" to comile to program, and then ./prog <name of file> to run it. The make file should also have a "make clean" command to remove all object and program files.
